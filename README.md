# Summary

This project is meant to explore the new platform-independent alternative to Electron, Tauri. This framework is built utilizing Rust for a memory-light experience of creating stand alone applications using Javascript and various other packages.

The project will take the form of an API-rich splash page for bringing together relevant information I'm interested in at the start of a day such as weather, news, inspirational quotes and bits of info, etc.

We will also use this as an opportunity for getting increased experience with ReactJS, which will be interesting to use in the Tauri environment.
